Exercise 1:

Starter Code:
SELECT *

WHERE event_name = 'view_item'

Solution: 

Exercise 2:
Goal: Write a query to format the view_item event into a table with the appropriate columns
(This replicates what we had in the slides, but it is missing a column)

Starter Code:
SELECT
event_id,
event_time,
user_id,
platform
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = 'item_id'
      THEN CAST parameter_value AS INT
      ELSE NULL
      END) AS item_id
FROM dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = 'view_item'
ORDER BY event_id

Exercise 3:
Goal: Use the result from the previous exercise, but make sure

Starter Code:
SELECT
  event_id,
  event_time,
  user_id,
  platform,
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = 'item_id'
      THEN CAST (parameter_value AS INT)
      ELSE NULL
      END) AS item_id,
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = 'referrer'
      THEN parameter_value 
      ELSE NULL
      END) AS referrer,
FROM dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = 'view_item'
ORDER BY event_id
